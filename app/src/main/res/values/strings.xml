    <string name="randall_description">Funding to construct a library at the new campus location began in 1965 by the Friends of Wilmington College. The first on-site library was housed in Alderman Hall administration building following the move from Isaac Bear Building. In 1968, the original front of Randall Library faced College Road but since its 1980s expansion the entrance now faces Chancellors Walk. This facility contains UNCW Archives, Special Collections (Helen Hagan Room), the Gene Huguelet Conference Room, and the Honors Program offices, along with various faculty offices.</string>

    <string name="burney_name">Burney Center</string>
    <string name="burney_description">Occupied in 1985, the Burney Student Support Center contained the University Bookstore, the Parking/Student ID Office and the Department of Communication Studies, which moved to Leutze Hall in 2003. The dedication ceremony for the center was held November 1989. In 2006, the bookstore moved to the new Fisher Student Center. Renovations of the Burney Student Support Center began in 2006, and the building was reopened in March 2008 as mainly a meetings and events facility. The name was shortened to the \"Burney Center".The renovated Burney Center includes a 9,300 square foot ballroom, which seats nearly 600 guests banquet style and close to 1,000 guests auditorium style.The Burney Center also features a colonnade connecting the Burney Center with the new Fisher Student Center. A part of the original construction plans, the colonnade project was cut due to a lack of funds. The Parent's Council then decided to raise money for the colonnade to be built and approximately $190,000 was raised to go towards its construction. It was unveiled on April 5, 2008.</string>
